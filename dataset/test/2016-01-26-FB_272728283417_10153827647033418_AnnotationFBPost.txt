<activity_name_LxKyMA7eXL>【歷史塵埃－劉芸怡個展】</activity_name_LxKyMA7eXL>

藝術家對於空間變化過程如何影響人的心理感興趣，藉由拍攝不同城市及歷史文化脈絡中傾頹、無人居住的房屋，將逐漸崩壞破敗的建築空間與人之情感記憶作聯結。經過時間緩慢轉變的空間，實體化隱匿其後的歷史故事。絕大多數這些衰敗建築是完全封閉無法進入的場所。時間靜止其中，空間不再具有生命力。然而劉芸怡將廢墟視為記憶承載體、歷史紀念碑以及時空過往的集合。透過影像創作過程使消逝空間的意義被提升、價值被轉化。重新開啟廢棄空間與城市、歷史對話的可能性，在其衰敗荒蕪之中找尋另一層意義的再生。

展覽好評進行中，展期至<activity_date_end_LxKyMA7eXL>2月21日</activity_date_end_LxKyMA7eXL>～

【Dust of History - Solo Exhibition of Yunyi Liu】

The artist is interested in how spatial transformation affects human psychology. By shooting abandoned, uninhabited buildings in different cities, historical and cultural contexts, she connects the collapsing architectural spaces and people's emotional memories. The slowly changing space has materialized the subsequent histories. Most of these degraded buildings are completely isolated and unreachable, where the time ceases and the space loses its vitality. However, Liu sees the ruins as the complex of memory carriers, historical monuments and time and space of the past. Through the creation of images, the meanings of vanished spaces are elevated, and the values are transformed. It reopens the possibility of conversation between the abandoned space, city, and history. Therefore the reborn of another layer of meaning could be found among the decays.
