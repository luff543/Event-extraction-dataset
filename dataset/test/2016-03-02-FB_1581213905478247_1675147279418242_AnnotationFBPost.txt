藝文樓是一個位在屏東市區的小規模獨立藝文空間，以貼近正面健康的生活結合多元藝文，藝文樓團隊運用現有資源與想像力建立根基，這個潛力無窮的藝文場所需要大家的資源支持與團結推動，並在同等價值觀下透過互相交流與交換，一起讓藝文樓發展成屏東在地的平臺。The Place of the Arts is an independent establishment providing a diverse, vibrant, and positive environment for the development of the arts in Pingtung. With lots of potential and space the establishment requires additional help, investment, ideas, and resources to continue to provide the community with themed events, live performances, art exhibitions, classes in personal development, and healthy vegetarian food.
