 展出藝術家｜李丞夏、李和典、尹元根⋯⋯
 　
 三位韓國藝術家在創作中尋找一片悠然之境，周旋在回憶、融合、循環以富詩意的畫面表現，三位韓國藝術家的作品以各自創新且特殊的表現手法，透過韓式美學的呈現，使觀賞者周遊凝視於自我內心那股寧靜的力量。 藝術家李丞夏喜歡在大自然中尋找美，將陰陽協調的能量原則注入於畫布，不透過自身加以繪製，而是用以媒材本身自然的流動特性，任由媒材本身結合身體的律動，體現物質本身的生命力，如同世界萬物的生命展現般，作品所呈現的海洋與天空，顏色的對比也猶有太極的意念，象徵著萬物之間相互調和的影響。 李和典的創作在特殊的絲質半透明的畫布上繪製魚的圖形，結合獨特的膠彩和粉彩物料，在表面上堆疊出池塘的深度，以創新的圖像表現出立體的效果，突破平面作品所能表達的限制，達到了空間感和活力。端看作品，池塘表面似乎靜如止水，透過多面的觀察卻可以感受到水裡的波瀾，小魚在這個立體空間內無目的游移，乘載著猶如孩子的美好回憶，也擁有在夜晚時無法測量的哀傷感受。 藝術家尹元根將以仿舊復古、紀實油畫的攝影風格，意念過往遊走法國巴黎的景色，特殊的攝影視角透過藝術家的表現，在畫面之中猶如再度走透巴黎風景，在回憶之中周旋。藝術家認為攝影所能達成的感觸是無以測量的，攝影勾勒出過去的記憶、凝視風景的視角，觀者在觀看作品也能夠深有所感。

 The three Korean artists are seeking for a leisurely place within their own creation, and surrounding with the memories, fusion, and cycles to express poetic-like artworks. The works of the three Korean artist, Seung-Ha LEE, Hwa-Jeon LEE, and Won-Keun YOON, use their own innovative and unique techniques to present the artworks. The viewers could travel into and stare at the peaceful power within their soul through this aesthetics of Korean style.
 　
 Artist Seung-Ha LEE likes to find beauty in nature, and injects the harmonious energy principle of yin and yang into the canvas. Seung-Ha LEE does not draw the works directly, but uses the natural flowing of the material itself, allowing the material to combine with the body's rhythm of artist to reflect the liveness. Just like all lives of the world, the contrast between the ocean and the sky presented in the work also has the idea of ​​Tai Chi, which symbolizes the influence of reconciling all lives of the world.
 　
 The works of Hwa-Jeon LEE draws fishes on a special watery silk canvas, combining unique materials, which are pastel and bunchae, and stacking the depth of the pond. Showing a three-dimensional effect which also breaked through the limitations in graphic works and have reached a sense of space and vitality. Looking at the work, the surface of the pond seems to be still, but the waves in the water can be felt through multi-observation. The small fish swims purposelessly in the pond, seems carrying good memories from childhood, also carrying the feelings of sadness which cannot be measured.
 　
 Artist Won-Keun YOON uses the old-fashioned retro and realistic oil painting styles to memorize the sceneries of Paris, France. Through the artist's special perspective of photography, it’s like walking into the landscape of Paris again and wandering in memories.  The artist believes that the feelings which photography achieves are beyond measure. Photography recalls the memory from the past and reappears the perspective of gazing at the landscape. The viewer can also feel deeply when watching the work.
