Congratulations to the “Educational Service Group” from Taiwan National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) for being accorded the “Belize Youth Awards 2019”from Hon. P⋯⋯atrick Faber, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education held at Belize Youth Awards Ceremony on November 29, 2019.  Since 2011, NTHU’s “Educational Service Group” organized and prepared voluntary students from the university to host summer camp for Belizean students from schools in variant districts. They also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Youth Services of the Ministry of Education to enable selective Belizean students to continue their education. Before making their annual trip to Belize, members of NTHU group must spend at least 6 months in fundraising from many organizations or companies in Taiwan for ICT equipment donated to needy schools in Belize.  This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Belize and Taiwan. The Embassy is glad and also proud that NTHU Group was been selected as a recipient of this year’s meaningful “Belize Youth Awards”. We also would like to express our gratitude to Hon. Deputy Prime Minister Faber and the Ministry of Education in Belize for honoring Taiwanese students by issuing this special award.    
 恭喜「清華大學國際志工貝里斯團隊」榮獲由貝里斯副總理兼教育部長法博(Patrick Faber)所頒發的「<activity_name_LxKyMA7eXL>2019貝里斯青年獎</activity_name_LxKyMA7eXL>」  「清大志工團」自2011年起，每年夏天都會來到貝里斯舉辦夏令營，協助貝里斯學生學習上網、使用電腦及應用軟體。他們還與貝國教育部簽署備忘錄，甚至花上至少半年時間努力募款爭取贊助，捐贈貝國學校各種資訊設備，並發放獎學金，提供較為窮困的貝國學子升學機會。  今年適逢臺貝建交30週年，駐貝里斯大使館除了祝賀國立清華大學及該校「國際志工貝里斯團隊」榮獲「2019貝里斯青年獎」之外，也為我們臺灣年輕世代的犧牲奉獻精神感到驕傲，並對各位發揮全民外交理念，協助提升臺貝關係，表達由衷感謝。 清華大學國際志工貝里斯團隊 國立清華大學National Tsing Hua University
