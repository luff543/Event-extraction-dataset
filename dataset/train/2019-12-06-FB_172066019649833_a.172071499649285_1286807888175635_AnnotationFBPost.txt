今年的感恩節對台南嬰兒之家有特別的意義與氛圍~
 我們為等家的大孩子舉辦文化體驗營活動，在三位志工老師熱情的引領下，藉由不同語言的傳遞，饒富趣味的遊戲及豐富的傳統飲食，擴展孩子對多元文化的視野，逐步建構未來生活的認知，想像與認同~ 在此，感謝東南扶輪社以及成大國際學生志工的鼎力相助與支持才得以促成 活動的進行。
 我們的一小步幫助每個等家的孩子邁向家的夢想與期盼，也為孩子的人生注入愛的溫潤與希望。⋯⋯ This Thanksgiving has a special meaning for Good Shepherd Foundation.
 We organized culture experience camps for elder children. Under the enthusiastic guidance of three volunteer teachers and through the interested games and abundance traditional cuisine, children have different view of multiculturalism. They can gradually construct cognition, imagination and identification for their future life.
 Here, we thank for the assistance and support of Rotary Club of Tainan Southeast and International Student Volunteers of National Cheng Kung University. The activity won’t be successfully completed without them.
 Our small steps help every child moves toward their dreams and expectations of home and also bring them love and hope.
